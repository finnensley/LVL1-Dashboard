# Create A Personal Dashboard

## Goals: 

### Dynamic welcome message based on the time of day
### Weather widget (Fetch API - OpenWeather)
### To-do list (Local Storage)
### Notes section (Local Storage); localStorage.setItems("key", "value")  console.log(localStorage.getItem("key"))
### Navigation between sections (home, weather, tasks, notes)
### Responsive design
### Contact Form

# Challenge:
## Add @media for different devices
## Fix Notecards: trashcan/light is infront of text. Use CSS positioning? 
## Add a contact me form on greetings page ? 
## Explore using flex or grid for header
## nav bar doesn't align perfectly with the image mode, change "image" to "dark" 
## Add a footer with a link to a contact form? 
## Create a contact form, is this just a link to email in the footer or a full form? Look at doing both
## Make greetings page look better in light mode, add footer or aside ??





## Done:
## Add an ease to the font being larger as scroll over nav buttons
## Work on making grey Mode look better for the About page, tie in features to about, add more content to buttons ?? spacing ?
## Play with adjusting the My Dashboard heading and nav bar to be at the top but sticky and the content in the center to scroll up/down. 
## Fix the Type Your Name box to clear the name after Save Name button is clicked
## Add light/dark theme to the top of each page to take the background out to white with black text ??
